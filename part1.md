Part 1 : UCD & Site Planning (50 pts)
To experience the User Centered Design (UCD) process you should create a design document that
contains the following points for the plan of your personal portfolio site. (If you already have one and
would like to pursue another topic, you will need to complete Part 1 early and receive approval from the
TA (Ethan Lee)). We recommend reading section 2 before doing this phase as you may see it
informs your decisions here.
Your report should include the following:
A short summary of the purpose of the site. (4 pts)

A section on audience considerations, consisting of at least one persona diagram.  While it should
be convincingly realistic, you SHOULD make up the persona (i.e. you shouldn't have to find someone
in real life to complete this part). Here is a link  (https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/) that might help. Examples and an explanation of
persona diagrams can also be found here  (https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-persona-
templates/) , and here's  (https://figma.com/) a tool that you can use to create one. (6 pts)

A site diagram that shows individual pages, navigation titles, and file names.  You may decide to
annotate the diagram with more information about page purpose if you see fit.  Examples and an
explanation of site diagrams can be found here  (https://online.visual-
paradigm.com/diagrams/templates/site-map-diagram/simple-website-sitemap/) , and here's
(https://app.diagrams.net/) a tool that you can use to create one.   (10 pts)

Wireframe(s) that detail the various pages in your site.  Your wireframe(s) should NOT be high-
fidelity. Examples and an explanation of wireframes can be found here
(https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/) , and here's
(https://figma.com/) a tool that you can use.   (10 pts)

Points may be removed at the instructor's discretion if the project as a whole is too limited in scope.
While we won't tell you exactly what to include and what not to include in your site, we do expect that
your page goes a bit beyond just being a laundry list of your projects and experience/achievements. You
should end up having enough material to create multiple unique pages. If not, assume you did too little
and that you won't get full credit.

The plan should conclude with the following two sections:
\1. Technical requirements -  some details about what you plan on doing in execution, where it will be
hosted, etc.  Technical requirements might include things like technologies possible to use, target
browser and device profiles, page delivery targets in bytes, etc. (6 pts)
\2. Content requirements - details about type of content you will need to gather or write, this may
include any media assets you need.  You will not need all this content on the initial build of phase 1. 
However, by HW3, most content should be in place at least visually (moving from low fidelity to high
fidelity wireframes), so plan accordingly. (6 pts)

Lastly,  Quality of Presentation will matter, accounting for the remaining 8 pts.
The essential pieces of the design document (such as wireframes, site maps, technical requirements,
etc.) should be produced with tools appropriate for the kind of content you are trying to produce.
The submission, like in HW1, is a single PDF file with appropriate formatting for screen or print
reading. Do NOT submit with hyperlinks (i.e. please directly paste the full url to relevant sites) since
graders cannot interact with the contents of your PDF on Gradescope.
